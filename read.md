Create account form 

In this project, I have written 2 files, one form.html file and another style.css file. 
Both of the files are linked together. 
All you need to do is download or copy the text of the files making sure extensions of each file are correct. 
Download logo.png file. 
keep all of the three files in same location/folder.
Open the html file in your browser. 
You will be able to view your "Create account form".
