Create account form \n

In this project, I have written 2 files, one form.html file and another style.css file. 
Both the files are linked together. 
All you need to do is download or copy the text of the files making sure extensions are correct. 
Download logo.png file. 
Open the html file in your browser. 
You will be able to view you creat account form.
